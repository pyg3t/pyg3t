Welcome to PyG3T's documentation!
=================================

PyG3T (short for Python GetText Translation Toolkit) is a set of pure Python
tools to work with .po-files as a translator.

The toolkit consist of:
 * **gtgrep**: perform grep-like operations on po-files
 * **podiff**: generate diffs of po-files, such that each differing entry is printed completely
 * **poabc**: check for common translation errors, such as missing capitalization or punctuation
 * **gtxml**: check xml in translations
