   chunk
      Chunk refer to the chunk of text in a .po file that corresponds to a
      :term:`message`. The whole file consist of such chunks separated by a
      blank line. See the entry for :term:`message` for an example of what a
      chunk looks like.
      
   fuzzy
      Fuzzy if a flag that can be set programmatically when extracting strings
      for translation or manually by the translator. It is used to indicate
      that the translation may no longer be valid. Once the translator has
      reviewed (and possibly corrected) the string, the flag is removed.

      See the `gettext reference documentation
      <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Fuzzy-Entries.html#Fuzzy-Entries>`_
      for details.

   gettext catalog
      A gettext catalog is a collection of gettext :term:`message` s and a
      header with metadata. It is most often contained in a .po file. The
      header is the message with and empty :term:`msgid` and is usually the
      first message of the file. In pyg3t a gettext catalog is represented by
      the :py:class:`pyg3t.gtparse.Catalog` class.

   message
      A message refers to all data and metadata pertaining to a single
      translatable string in a :term:`gettext catalog`. The data consist of the
      :term:`msgid` (original string) and the :term:`msgstr` (translated
      string), both of which can optionally have plural forms. The metadata
      consist of references to source code lines for the msgids and optionally
      a comment, context and a previous version of the msgid. In pyg3t a
      message is represented by the classes :py:class:`pyg3t.gtparse.Message`
      and :py:class:`pyg3t.gtparse.ObsoleteMessage`.

      A typical message could look like this (inspired by the Danish translation
      of nautilus) (FIXME better example):

      .. code-block:: po

        # Ahh, nautilus can run programs
        #: ../data/nautilus-autorun-software.desktop.in.in.h:1
        msgid "Run Software"
	msgstr "KÃ¸r programmer"

      for details.
